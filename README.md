## Author

## Objective
Create a console application in C# using two examples. The first example calculates the natural number a^n without using any arithmetic operations other than multiplication. 
The second example involves a number  x  containing more than two digits, where its second digit is removed. When the second digit of x is appended to the right of the resulting number, the result is the number n.

## Description
The program raises a base a to the power n , with values entered via the keyboard. 
Additionally, a number x is entered, after which its second digit is removed, and the final number is displayed.

## Input Data
- Base: entered via the keyboard
- Exponent: entered via the keyboard
- Initial number: entered via the keyboard

## Expected Results
The program outputs two numbers:
- The result of calculating  a^n .
- The final number after processing the initial number.
